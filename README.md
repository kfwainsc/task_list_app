# Task List App

This app was written two different ways, but each resulting in the same functionality.

## Version 1 (Function Components)

AppFunctions.js

## Version 2 (Class Components)

AppClass.js is written using a class.
The rendering logic has been delegated to separate presentational function components. This AppClass component uses a constructor, its own class methods, as well as this.setState() and this.render() methods from Reactâ€™s Component class.
